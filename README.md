# MIT-OCW-Course

  Course offered by MIT through their Open Course Ware platform. All of the course material can be found on the website for MIT Open Courseware, https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm. Working thorugh the course helped me to build a much more solid and concrete understanding of the different facets of the Python programming and their applications. All code written in Python 3.
